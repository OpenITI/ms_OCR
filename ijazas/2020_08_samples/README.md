First reading notes samples provided by Konrad in August 2020.

"I hope the way they are organised makes sense (edited ijaza note in word file + pic). 
When I added 'cropped' to the folder name there is no other significant writing on the pic 
other than the edited ijaza note (in most cases the pics have indeed been cropped; 
in some cases we were lucky and there was just nothing else on the page). 
Consequently, all folders without 'cropped' in their name do have additional 
writing on the pic, writing that is not linked to the edited ijaza note.
